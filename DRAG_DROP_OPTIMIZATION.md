## 🎯 Best Practices

### For Fastest Results:
1. Use **drag & drop** or **paste** for convenience
2. Take clear, well-lit photos
3. Avoid very large images (compression handles it, but smaller is still faster)
4. Ensure food items are visible and not overlapping too much

### For Best Accuracy:
- Clear focus on food items
- Good lighting
- Multiple angles if items overlap
- Close-up shots work best

- Check file format is supported

### Paste Not Working?
- Copy image first (screenshot or right-click copy)
- Click on the page to focus it
- Press Ctrl+V (or Cmd+V)

### Still Slow?
- Check your internet connection
- OpenRouter API might be experiencing high load
- Try again in a few moments
